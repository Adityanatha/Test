This directory should contain your Google service account credentials JSON file used for accessing Google Sheets.
Place the file here and update `gsheets.creds_json` in `config.yaml` to point to it, e.g. `datafiles/google-credentials.json`.
The credentials file itself should not be committed to version control.
